							<p>Sometimes nature whispers of fragility or
								interconnectedness. Sometimes it offers contemplation in moments
								of deep silence. At other times nature shouts. When the
								thousands of waterlilies bloom on the lake in Barisal known as
								Shaplar Beel, “Lake of the Waterlilies,” nature reminds in loud
								announcement that life is a great celebration. Children's smiles
								are broad and unstoppable then, as they move about in country
								boats collecting delicate petal parcels. A boy clutches a bundle
								of lily stems triumphantly. A girl tries out a blossom as
								adornment for her hair... For adults too, the floral display on
								the waterhole which borders Satla village in Barisal's Ujirpur
								upazila and Bagda and Khajuria villages in adjacent Agailjhara
								upazila and stretches over a thousand hectares, by local
								estimate, can only bring delight. “Nobody knows the lake's
								history,” says an elderly man, “But since childhood I have seen
								waterlilies blossom here. It's really enjoyable.” The lake hosts
								species that flower in white and purple too. Traditionally the
								plants have offered villagers not only the radiant beauty of
								their flowers but a source of income. Many collect waterlilies
								still, for sale as a vegetable in local markets. “Most of the
								year I sell lilies from this lake,” says Abul Jabbar of Bagda
								village.</p>

							<p>“I can get up to five taka per bundle of twenty stems,
								which gives a daily income of around 250 taka.” From selling
								waterlilies Jabbar maintains his family of seven, he says. Like
								Jabbar at least a hundred other poor families rely on lilies.
								Shaplar Beel's lilies are sold at markets across Barisal, and as
								far away as Pirojpur and Faridpur. Still others make a
								livelihood from fishing. “There is plenty of natural food for
								fish in this lake,” says fisherman Romesh Gharami of Khajuria
								village, “I normally achieve a good catch here.” Walking fish,
								butter fish, mullet and fry are available year-round, Gharami
								says, bringing him an income of up to 500 taka per day from
								which he supports his family of five. Yet waterlily production
								at the lake is on the decline, with local sources identifying
								siltation which is decreasing the lake's depth as a problem.
								Moreover some have commenced fish cultivation in the lake,
								building dams inside it which alter the traditional ecosystem.</p>

							<p>But for now, life continues for the most part following
								tradition at Shaplar Beel, with the brilliance of its annual
								waterlily display in full force as usual, to welcome the winter.</p>
